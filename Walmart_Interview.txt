1.  input = [ 'A', 'B','C', 1, 2, 3, '4', '5', 6, '@', '~', 'D' ]

                 * Split the string, integer, and special characters into new arrays.
                 * Make sure 4 and 5 which is a string should be in integer array list and convert it to integer.

         Console Output:
                 integer = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
                 string = [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' ]
                 chars = [ '@', '~' ]


Solution:
const input = ["A", "B", "C", 1, 2, 3, "4", "5", 6, "@", "~", "D"];
const integers = [];
const strings = [];
const chars = [];

input.forEach((item) => {
  if (typeof item === "number") {
    integers.push(item);
  } else if (!isNaN(item)) {
    integers.push(parseInt(item, 10));
  } else if (typeof item === "string" && item.match(/[a-zA-Z]/)) {
    strings.push(item);
  } else {
    chars.push(item);
  }
});

window.console.log("integers:", integers);
window.console.log("strings:", strings);
window.console.log("chars:", chars);

Q2. Follow-up questions for integer array.
            integer = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
                 * Split it to 2 arrays with random elements and sum each array
                   example:
                          Output_1:
                            array_1 = [ 1,4,6 ]
                            array_2 = [ 2,3,5 ]
                          Output_2: Sum each array
                            array_1 = 11
                            array_2 = 10

Solution:


function splitArray(arr) {
  // shuffle methods randomly
  const shf = arr.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  // const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const mid = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length);
  //mid range
  const arr1 = shf.slice(0, mid);
  const arr2 = shf.slice(mid);
  //reduce
  const sum1 = arr1.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  const sum2 = arr2.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  //sum sd gqq
  window.console.log("firstArray:", arr1, "sum1", sum1);
  window.console.log("secondArray:", arr2, "sum2", sum2);
}

splitArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);

9. What is typescript and javascript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all of JavaScript's features and adds more of its own. 
The primary addition is static typing, which allows developers to define the types of variables, function parameters, 
and return values.

10. difference between TS and JS?
TypeScript is known as an Object-oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a prototype-based language.
TypeScript has a feature known as Static typing but JavaScript does not support this feature.
TypeScript supports Interfaces but JavaScript does not.
Feature	TypeScript	JavaScript
Typing	Provides static typing	Dynamically typed
 
Tooling	Comes with IDEs and code editors 	Limited built-in tooling
 
Syntax	Similar to JavaScript, with additional features 	Standard JavaScript syntax
 
Compatibility	Backward compatible with JavaScript 	Cannot run TypeScript in JavaScript files
 
Debugging	Stronger typing can help identify errors 	May require more debugging and testing
 
Learning curve 	Can take time to learn additional features 	Standard JavaScript syntax is familiar
